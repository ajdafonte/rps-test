# rps-test

Backend test, Apply SOLID principles to make a better server

## What to do ?

This is an open test, this means you can solve it anyhow. For simplicity and better understanding we have coded it in Java, but you can solve it in any language you would like
 
The project is a simple, incomplete and messy Rock, Paper, Scissors multiplayer game server and client. Your task if you decide to accept is to apply [S.O.L.I.D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) Principles
to refactor the project and turn it into an understandable and Maintainable piece of software. 

Create a branch for your work where you will be able to change structure, naming of files or whatever you need to make it right,
please remember to do proper naming and refactor in english, do whatever you think is necessary to make it clean and playable, [Clean code shall guide your steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMuno5RZNeE)

One thing left behind was to register users in the server as players, right now we have two types of players "registeredPlayer" and "guestPlayer",
both of them should be able to play Rock, Paper, Scissors but whenever a client enters the game only registered ones should receive greetings from the server.

Of course you will get extra points if you get tests and or TDD made right. 

## What we will evaluate ? 

Basically your thinking about where stuff should be placed in code, also your ability to get rid of cyclomatic complexity

## How to report the result ? 

Once you have refactor the project please send us by email the pull request link, but by any means do not affect the master branch directly.
